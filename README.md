Terminal Shield for Photon / Electron / Lopy 

This is a shield that allows you to mount a Particle.io Photon / Electron or a pycom.io Lopy / Wipy and use screw
terminals to connect to the board pins instead of jumpers which can be quite flaky, especially if you want to move the board around which is often the case with IoT projects.

I am new to Eagle so this is a first attempt and hence the board is ugly and not even square. However I have had this baord fabricated and it does work. It also has the parts for the screw terminals and headers if you don't want to solder those on by hand.

Submit a pull request if you want to improve the board..
